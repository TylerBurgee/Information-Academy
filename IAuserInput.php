		<h2>Python Lesson #4: User-Input</h2>

			<h2 id='header'>User-Input</h2>
			<p>
				In this lesson, we will talk about user-input. User-input is the key to computer programming: without it, no one could actually interact with the program you have made. All we have to do to get user-input is the following: <i>input('Enter Prompt Message Here: ')</i>. When asking the user for input, we. should always assign this input to a variable to store the information: <i>name = input('Enter Your Name: ')</i>. It is good to put a space at the end so that the users typing won't collide with the prompt message.

				We are going to now make a program that asks for your name, then it will say hello to the user. To do this we simply assign a variable to input, then print hello and the user-input. We will explain in detail how to do this in our next lesson, but for now, just write down the code below.

				You are doing fantastic! We have already learned so much! Often times when learning how to program, you will want to sit on your computer all day learning: remember to get off the computer, complete things that need to get done, talk to your family and friends, and don't spend your whole day on the computer. If you are looking for ways to strengthen your relationship with your parents, I strongly reccomend <a href='IAstore.php' id='ItemLink'>"Bridging The Gap Between You And Your Folks"</a> located in our store. If you liked this lesson, please reccomend us to family and friends.
