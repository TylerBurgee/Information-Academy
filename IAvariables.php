			<p>
				In this lesson we will cover what variables are and how to use them in computer programming.<br />What is a variable? A variable is an element, feature, or factor that is liable to vary or change. To make a variable, we simply say what we want the name of the variable to be, then assign what it will be equal to.

				To print a variable, it is very simple: you do not need to put quotation marks or anything, just write the name of the variable. The reason for this is: when you put a variable in <i>print()</i>, the computer does not read the variable name, it reads the contents.
